<h1 align="center">HTTP Toolkit Pro Patcher</h1>

<p align="center">
  <strong>Updated and working on the latest version as of 10/04/2026 (1.25.0)</strong>
</p>

This is a simple tool to patch the HTTP Toolkit Pro app to enable the Pro features without a license or subscription. **But please consider supporting the developer by purchasing a license if you find the HTTP Toolkit useful.**

This is an updated version of the original HTTP Toolkit Pro Patcher. The original patcher by [XielQ](https://github.com/XielQs) became obsolete due to changes in newer versions of HTTP Toolkit (ES Modules, ASAR integrity checks, etc.). [Jefriline](https://github.com/Jefriline) completely rewrote it to work with HTTP Toolkit v1.24.x, and this fork extends compatibility to **v1.25.0.**.

**But please consider supporting the developer by purchasing a license if you find HTTP Toolkit useful.**

## Important: Pre-requisites

Before patching, you **MUST** disable the ASAR integrity check in HTTP Toolkit. This is required because Electron validates the integrity of the `app.asar` file, and our patch modifies it.

### Step 1: Disable ASAR Integrity Check

Run this command in PowerShell (Windows) or Terminal (macOS/Linux):

**Windows:**
```powershell
npx --yes @electron/fuses write --app "C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\AppData\Local\Programs\HTTP Toolkit\HTTP Toolkit.exe" EnableEmbeddedAsarIntegrityValidation=off OnlyLoadAppFromAsar=off
```

**macOS:**
```bash
npx --yes @electron/fuses write --app "/Applications/HTTP Toolkit.app" EnableEmbeddedAsarIntegrityValidation=off OnlyLoadAppFromAsar=off
```

**Linux:**
```bash
npx --yes @electron/fuses write --app "/opt/HTTP Toolkit/httptoolkit" EnableEmbeddedAsarIntegrityValidation=off OnlyLoadAppFromAsar=off
```

> **Note:** Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual Windows username. You can find the exact path by right-clicking on HTTP Toolkit shortcut and selecting "Open file location".

> **Important:** You need to run this command **every time you reinstall or update HTTP Toolkit**, as the update will restore the original integrity checks.

## Installation & Usage

### Step 2: Clone and Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mcmalte26/httptoolkit-pro-patcher
cd httptoolkit-pro-patcher
npm install
```

### Step 3: Apply the Patch

```bash
node . patch
```

If HTTP Toolkit is not auto-detected, specify the path manually:

**Windows:**
```powershell
node . patch --path "C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\AppData\Local\Programs\HTTP Toolkit"
```

**macOS:**
```bash
node . patch --path "/Applications/HTTP Toolkit.app"
```

**Linux:**
```bash
node . patch --path "/opt/HTTP Toolkit"
```

### Step 4: Start HTTP Toolkit

You can start HTTP Toolkit normally from the Start Menu/Applications, or use the patcher to start it with debug logs:

```bash
node . start --path "PATH_TO_HTTP_TOOLKIT"
```

That's it! The HTTP Toolkit should now have the Pro features enabled.

## CLI Reference

```sh
Usage: node . <command> [options]

Commands:
  patch    Patch HTTP Toolkit
  repatch  Restore and repatch HTTP Toolkit (re-applies the patch)
  restore  Restore HTTP Toolkit to original state
  start    Start HTTP Toolkit with debug logs enabled

Options:
      --version      Show version number                                   [boolean]
  -p, --proxy        Specify a global proxy (only http/https supported)     [string]
  -P, --path         Specify the path to the HTTP Toolkit folder (auto-detected by
                     default)                                                [string]
  -c, --custom-mail  Prompt for a custom email instead of using a random one           [boolean]
  -h, --help         Show this help message                                [boolean]
```

## Restoring Original HTTP Toolkit

If you want to remove the patch and restore HTTP Toolkit to its original state:

```bash
node . restore --path "PATH_TO_HTTP_TOOLKIT"
```

## Re-patching HTTP Toolkit

If you need to re-apply the patch, use the `repatch` command. This is a shortcut that restores the original version and then applies the patch again:

```bash
node . repatch --path "PATH_TO_HTTP_TOOLKIT"
```

## Using a Custom Email

By default, the patcher generates a random email address. You can prompt for a custom email using the `--custom-mail` option:

```bash
node . patch --custom-mail
# or
node . patch -c
```

This will prompt you to enter an email address interactively.

## Using with Proxy

If you want to add a proxy to the patcher, you can use the `--proxy` option:

```bash
node . patch --proxy http://x.x.x.x:8080
```

You can also set the `PROXY` environment variable:

```bash
# Linux/macOS
PROXY=http://x.x.x.x:8080 node . start

# Windows PowerShell
$env:PROXY="http://x.x.x.x:8080"; node . start
```

**Note**: The proxy must be an HTTPS/HTTP proxy. SOCKS proxies are not supported.

**Note**: `Proxy` is only used for the patcher. The HTTP Toolkit itself will not use the proxy, so you will need to configure the HTTP Toolkit to use the proxy if you want to use it.

## How it works

This tool:

1. **Patches the Electron app**: Injects code into HTTP Toolkit's `index.js` file
2. **Creates a local server**: Runs on port 5067 to intercept requests to `app.httptoolkit.tech`
3. **Modifies main.js**: Intercepts the `main.js` file and injects Pro user credentials
4. **Blocks telemetry**: Prevents HTTP Toolkit from sending analytics data

For more detailed information, see the [patch's source code](patch.js) or the [patcher](index.js) file.

**Tip**: You can change the `PORT` environment variable to use a different port. For example, `PORT=8080 node . start`.

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (v15 or higher) (with npm 7 at least)
- HTTP Toolkit installed

## Compatibility

## Troubleshooting

### "Integrity check failed for asar archive" Error

This means you haven't disabled the ASAR integrity check. Run the `@electron/fuses` command from [Step 1](#step-1-disable-asar-integrity-check).

**If you just updated HTTP Toolkit**, you need to run the fuses command again, then re-apply the patch.

### "HTTP Toolkit not found" Error

Specify the path manually using the `--path` option. Common paths:

- **Windows**: `C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\AppData\Local\Programs\HTTP Toolkit`
- **macOS**: `/Applications/HTTP Toolkit.app`
- **Linux**: `/opt/HTTP Toolkit` or `/usr/lib/httptoolkit`

### "No internet connection and file is not cached" Error

The patcher needs internet access to download HTTP Toolkit's web app files. Make sure:
1. You have an active internet connection
2. If using a proxy, ensure it's working correctly

### Permission Errors

- **Windows**: Run PowerShell as Administrator
- **Linux**: Run the command as `sudo`
- **macOS**: Enable "App Management" for your terminal emulator in System Preferences > Privacy & Security

### Java Attach APIs Error

If you see this error:
```
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com/sun/tools/attach/AgentLoadException
=> Java attach APIs are not available
```

**This is NOT a problem.** It's just HTTP Toolkit trying to use Java debugging features which are not available. The patcher still works correctly.

### After Updating HTTP Toolkit

Every time you update HTTP Toolkit:
1. Run the `@electron/fuses` command to disable integrity checks
2. Run `node . patch` again to re-apply the patch
